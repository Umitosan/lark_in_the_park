# _Lark in the Park_

#### By _**Dominic Brown**_

_(Independent project @ Epicodus - 7/21/17)_

## Description

This small app provides a simple public API endpoint for looking up state and national parks in the USA.

## User stories

* As a user, I want to make a call to return a list of all state parks.
* As a user, I want to make a call to return a list of all national parks.
* As a user, I want to make a call to return a list of all parks for a single state.
* As a user, I want to make a call to return a random park.
* As a user, I want to make a custom call that searches for parks using my input.
* As a user, I want my calls to return on multiple pages so I don't receive too much data at once.
* As a user, I want my calls to return serialized data (i.e. 'park' data is nested under 'state' ).
